This is our technical challenge to assess your qualifications as a potential Jr. HTML & CSS Developer at Digix.Global.

*Task: Build the UI with HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.*

Requirements: 

	1. Enhance the look and feel of the web app with the new HTML5 and CSS3 features (use it in any way you like!)
	2. Feel free to use external libraries such as Bootstrap or Material UI. Building it with your own basic framework  is a plus! 
	3. Responsive so the web app looks great on all screen sizes.
	4. Make your code as elegant as possible.

All assets and UI mockup is uploaded here.
